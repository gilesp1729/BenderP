Bike power meter with speed, cadence and dynamic calibration.

Opposing-force power meter with BLE connection to popular cycling apps. Only sensors required are a Hall sensor with a wheel magnet.

Works in progress
Static calibration of accelerometer orientation stored in non-volatile memory when first power up on a flat level surface.
Dynamic calibration of air and rolling resistance coefficients when not pedalling (requires cadence sensor)
